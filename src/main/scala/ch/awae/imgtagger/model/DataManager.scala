/**
 * Read-Only $DM with optional caching.
 *
 * The $DM must ensure thread safety and data
 * consistency. Data is indexed and the indexing must
 * be changeable through re-indexing. Re-Indexing must
 * also be thread safe. The $DM is always keeping track
 * of on ''selected'' element. Other items can be selected
 * by use of the navigation methods `stepForward`,
 * `stepBackward`, `<<` and `>>`. Elements can be filtered.
 * The navigation methods always operate on the filtered
 * element set. There is always exactly one selected element.
 * The only exceptions are if the element set is empty (`fullSize == 0`)
 * and/or the current filtered element set is empty (`setSize == 0`)
